# Scaling evidence based social outcomes

Tokenized Impact Bonds (TIBs) disrupt social impact bondsâ€”debt instruments where returns are tied to the achievement of desired social outcomesâ€”by leveraging the transparency and efficiency of blockchain.Operating on EVM-compatible platforms, TIBs utilize hybrid oracles that combine smart contract-powered evidence mapping with community intervention, ensuring actions align with commitments.

Participants ranging from funders to non-profits receive badges attesting to their cumulative contributions. Non-profits deploy Campaign Contracts to articulate goals and milestones creating Certboxes ensuring fair & randomised distributioin. Purchasing Certboxes unlock Impact Certificates which can be monetized for regrants using harberger auction or deposited in the treasury to obtain DAO tokens, maximizing their extracted value within its utility ecosystem. Independent evaluators consistently monitor and validate non-profit achievements.

| **Issue with Impact Bonds** | **Solution with Tokenized Impact Bonds** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **High setup and evaluation costs** | **Pay for performance Smart-Contracts** offer a cost-effective, modular and composable alternative.
| **Limited access to only well-funded entities** | **Decentralized, permissionless** engagement with smaller donors to scale their contributions. |
| **Stakeholder coordination challenge** | **DAO Ecosystem** minimizes admin costs and communication overhead. |
| **Steep Monitoring & Evaluation Cost (7-10%)** | **Hybrid Oracles & Algorithmic Evidence Mapping** to validate impact claims & link funding to outcomes. |
| **Difficulty in tangible recognition for donors** | **Certbox & Evaluated Hypercerts** for donations with an associated utility ecosystem. |
| **Private Underutilised Impact Databases** | **Record Impact on public chains** to streamline process of creating impact certificates from data. |
| **Scattered Ecosystems** | **Create a reserve assets backed by impact** to bridge Impact NFTs and Hypercerts onto a single platform. |


**Use of Funds**

- Resources guide users on utilizing Testnet which includes tutorials, how-to guides, and FAQs.
- Formulating an impact multiplier based on givewells analysis on impact from top charities fund.
- Gathering feedback from funders non-profits and evaluators to iterate mvp.
- All Community Contributions will go to our consensus staking fund which passively buys impact certificates.
